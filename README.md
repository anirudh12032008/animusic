# Ani Music
It's a really cool pcb which has a built in piano made fron sketch with the help of osciallations between RC circuit as each R has different value it generate different frequency which is then sent to 2 buzzers on each side. It uses NPN transistors to maintain all logic. It conneects electronics to music!!

## what it does?
it has 8 push buttons each of which represents a note and is linked to a different RC circuit

it uses a 3.7 battery

Its portable as it has a 3.7V battery attached to it

Each oscillator is a combination of a resistor and capacitor different resistor values = different frequencies = different notes

the signals from each of the RC circuit are amplified via transistors and sent to two buzzers
