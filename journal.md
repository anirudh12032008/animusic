## description: "It's a really cool pcb which has a built in piano made fron sketch with the help of osciallations between RC circuit as each R has different value it generate different frequency which is then sent to 2 buzzers on each side. It uses NPN transistors to maintain all logic. It conneects electronics to music!!"

## July 21 - Created the schematic 
so i have a big piano but i dont really use it because it occupies a lot of space so I though to create a pocket piano . so I opened easyeda and begun making the schematic and finding the footprints was a bit easy this time because i got familier with easyeda now. so yeah I was learning about RC oscillations right now so I used them instead of a 555 timer

## July 22 - Completed PCB and BOM
I started with the previous schematic and begun adding everything and it all fit perfectly I also added another buzzer to make it more cool. and then some cool silkart and it was all done!! the BOM was pretty hard to do as I needed to fit everything under $20 but yeah I did it
